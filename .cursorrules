# Tower Defense Game - Project Blueprint

## 🎮 Project Overview
A classic tower defense game built with Python + Pygame featuring strategic tower placement, wave-based enemy progression, and 5 levels of escalating difficulty. The game includes 5 tower types with unique mechanics, 12 enemy types with special abilities, upgrade systems, and complete sprite graphics.

## 🎯 Core Game Concept

### Objective
Defend your base by strategically placing towers along enemy paths to prevent waves of enemies from reaching the end across 5 challenging levels.

### Core Gameplay Loop
1. Place towers on designated grid spots
2. Manage gold resources earned from kills
3. Survive increasingly difficult enemy waves
4. Upgrade towers for enhanced performance
5. Master all 5 levels with unique challenges
6. Win by surviving all waves or lose when lives reach zero
