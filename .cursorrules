# Tower Defense Game - Project Blueprint

## üéÆ Project Overview
A classic tower defense game built with Python + Pygame focusing on strategic tower placement and wave-based enemy progression. The game features multiple tower types, diverse enemies, and progressive difficulty across a single handcrafted level.

## üéØ Core Game Concept

### Objective
Defend your base by strategically placing towers along enemy paths to prevent waves of enemies from reaching the end.

### Core Gameplay Loop
1. Place towers on designated grid spots
2. Manage gold resources earned from kills
3. Survive increasingly difficult enemy waves
4. Upgrade strategy as waves progress
5. Win by surviving all waves or lose when lives reach zero

- [ ] Tower targeting system (nearest, strongest, etc.)
- [ ] Gold reward system for enemy kills
- [ ] Basic particle effects for explosions

**Key Classes:**
```python
class Projectile:
    # position, velocity, damage, target tracking
    
class Tower:
    # range, damage, fire_rate, targeting, upgrade_level
    
class Enemy:
    # health, speed, position, path_progress, rewards
```

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Win/lose condition checking

**Wave Configuration:**
```python
WAVES = [
    # Wave 1-3: Tutorial waves
    {"basic": 10, "delay": 1.0},
    {"basic": 15, "delay": 0.8},
    {"basic": 20, "delay": 0.6},
