# Tower Defense Game - Project Blueprint

## 🎮 Project Overview
A classic tower defense game built with Python + Pygame focusing on strategic tower placement and wave-based enemy progression. The game features multiple tower types, diverse enemies, and progressive difficulty across a single handcrafted level.

## 🎯 Core Game Concept

### Objective
Defend your base by strategically placing towers along enemy paths to prevent waves of enemies from reaching the end.

### Core Gameplay Loop
1. Place towers on designated grid spots
2. Manage gold resources earned from kills
3. Survive increasingly difficult enemy waves
4. Upgrade strategy as waves progress
5. Win by surviving all waves or lose when lives reach zero

- Manual playtesting after each day's work
- Balance testing with different strategies
- Performance testing with many units on screen
- Edge case testing (no money, no lives, etc.)

This blueprint serves as the complete reference for building the tower defense game. All development should follow this structure and meet the specified success criteria for each phase.
